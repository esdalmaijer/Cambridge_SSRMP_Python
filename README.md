What is this?
=============

The *Introduction to Python*, offered by the University of Cambridge's Social Sciences Research Methods Programme (SSRMP). You likely came upon this page through the accompanying Moodle, where you can find further info on how to get in touch with the course organiser.

Pandemic preparedness
---------------------

When you signed up to this class, the plan was to be in a computer room for a whole day. Unfortunately, the current situation has made this impossible. That does not mean you can't learn Python, though! The class materials were translated into interactive worksheets that you can find below.

In a classroom, you could ask the teacher when you get stuck. Despite being interactive, these worksheets will _not_ respond to most of the questions that you might have. To make sure that you can get help when/if you get stuck, the teacher is on standby via an open Skype session. You can join this through a link published on the class' Moodle page.


Where am I?
===========

Welcome to GitHub! This is a website often described as a "social medium for coding", which doesn't fully do it justice. If you want to think of GitHub as an Instagram for computer code, it would only be accurate if Instagram maintained detailed and public histories of how posted photos were edited, and if people could openly discuss how to further improve collections of photos.

GitHub is a place where people can share their code in a collaborative setting. Their code _repositories_ are open for public comments, for example to point out bugs or potential improvements. It is also a great place to publicly host analysis code and, in some cases, data.


What should I do now that I'm here?
===================================

A few Jupyter Notebooks have been prepared for you. These are worksheets that will guide you through the beginnings of Python. The worksheets combine text and code within a single place. You have two options:

1. Run the Jupyter Notebooks through MyBinder, a website that allows you to run the Python code included in the worksheets within your your browser. You do not have to install anything for this.

2. Read the worksheets through this website, and copy the code into a local Python installation. This requires you install Python on your own computer.

Python is a programming language, and comes with a wide ecosystem of _packages_ that individuals and teams maintain. These include the truly fantastic packages NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. These offer essential functionality for science, including fast numerical operations, statistics, and plotting.

The aforementioned packages do not come with a basic installation of Python. However, there are distributions of Python that _do_ automatically come pre-packaged with these scientific tools! Perhaps the most well-known is Continuum's [Anaconda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZX4ooRsWs). You can download it through [their website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

Make sure you download the **Python 3.7 version**.
