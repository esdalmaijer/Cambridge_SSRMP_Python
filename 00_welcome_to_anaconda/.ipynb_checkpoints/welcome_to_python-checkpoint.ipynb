    "![spyder screenshot](spyder_with_annotations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Area A (yellow outline) is the code editor. This is where you will be writing script files. These are whole files that will not be run automatically, but only when you decide to run the whole file.\n",
    "- Area B (orange outline) is the help window. If you're confused about a function in the script, hit Ctrl+I, and info will appear in this window.\n",
    "- Area C (red outline) is the **console**. This is an interactive Python session. If you type a line in here and hit Enter, it will run straight away. Restarting the console (by clicking on the little cross next to its name) will wipe the memory.\n",
    "- Area D (green outline; all the way on the top) is the \"Run\" button. This will make the current script run in its entirety. It will be run line-by-line, using the active console. Any visible results will appear here too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spyder is a very decent editor, especially if you're used to Matlab or R Studio (both look very similar), or if you're completely new to coding. Code Editors are like text processors or slideshow software: There are several options, and each come with their own benefits and drawbacks. Like text or presentation files, script files are to construct a complete narrative to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could use the console as a quick calculator or to try out a few things. The code editor is for larger files, which could be entire analysis scripts, experiments, or a coherent set of functions for later use. Python scripts should be saved with the `.py` extension."
